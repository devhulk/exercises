# Excersizes for Application Development

Each excersise will have its own README.md and be comprised of multiple tasks.

Tasks vary in difficulty. (Easy, Intermediate, Hard)

This repository isn't focused on environment setup. It assumes you have the correct tools in place locally or points you to use other 3rd party tools.
